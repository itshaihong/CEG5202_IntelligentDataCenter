/*
 * sensors.c
 *
 * Purpose: Handle sensor initialization, data acquisition, and critical threshold checks.
 * Content:
 * Initialization functions for each sensor (HTS221, LPS22HB, LSM6DSL, LIS3MDL).
 * Functions to read data from sensors and store it in FIFO buffers.
 * Functions to check data against critical thresholds and trigger interrupts if necessary.
 *
 *
 * sensors.h
 *
 * Purpose: Declare sensor-related functions and data structures.
 * Content:
 * Function prototypes for sensor initialization and data acquisition.
 * Definitions of sensor data structures and critical thresholds.
